# VGA-Display--Pong-Game
•	Worked in a group of two to design the entities of this interactive multiplayer system using VHDL on Xilinx. It is implemented on a Spartan 6 FPGA board to integrating human input with the digital circuit. Output is via the VGA port.
•	To avoid the movement of the ball too quickly on the screen, an additional clock and reset was used for limiting the rate at which the data path runs, thus limiting the velocity of the ball.
