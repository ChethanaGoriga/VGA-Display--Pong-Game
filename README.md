# VGA-Display--Pong-Game
The game Pong is one of the first complete, standalone digital arcade games to reach
mainstream popularity. Pong, released in 1972, is a simple tennis-like game that pits
two players against each other on an almost-empty screen. A small, square ball
bounces back and forth between paddles controlled by two players, who attempt to
bounce it back at their opponent. If either player fails to hit the ball (it goes off the
edge of their screen), that player loses the round, and their opponent gets a point.

Project Achievement:
 The creation of a complete design of pong game, interactive system
 Further exploration of processes and behavioral description in VHDL
 Additional techniques for integrating human input with a digital circuit and implementing it on a FPGA board.
